{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**Epithelial Cells**\n\nEpithelial cells are a type of cell that play a crucial role in the structure and function of the toe pad. Specifically, they are found in the toe pad itself, where they form a layer of cells that contribute to its overall morphology and physiology. Additionally, epithelial cells can also be found surrounding channels within the toe pads, where they line the walls of these structures and facilitate various cellular processes.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by considering both descriptions as complementary aspects of the same entity, rather than mutually exclusive statements.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
