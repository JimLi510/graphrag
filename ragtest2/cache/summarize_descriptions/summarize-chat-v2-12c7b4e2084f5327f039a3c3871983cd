{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**TOE PADS**\n\nThe toe pads are a body part of frogs, specifically a structure located on the feet of tree frogs. They come into contact with the ground and serve as a location where fluid is secreted. In some species, such as Rhacophorus prominanus, the toe pads are responsible for secreting this fluid. Overall, the toe pads play an important role in the anatomy and physiology of frogs.\n\nNote: I resolved any potential contradictions by considering the descriptions collectively and providing a single, coherent summary that incorporates all relevant information.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
