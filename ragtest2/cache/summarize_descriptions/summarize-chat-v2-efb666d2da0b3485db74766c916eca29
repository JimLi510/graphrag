{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**Entities:** PDMS POLYGONAL ARRAYS, SURGICAL GRASPERS\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe PDMS POLYGONAL ARRAYS and SURGICAL GRASPERS are related entities. Specifically, PDMS arrays were applied to surgical graspers, indicating a functional or technological connection between the two. This suggests that the PDMS polygonal arrays are being used in conjunction with surgical graspers for some purpose, possibly as part of a medical device or procedure.\n\nNote: I resolved any potential contradictions by assuming that the \"organizations and event\" description was referring to the entities themselves, rather than their relationship.
