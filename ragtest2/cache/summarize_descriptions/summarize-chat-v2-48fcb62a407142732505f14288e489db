Specifically, they found that toe pads are optimally developed for friction rather than adhesion. This finding provides valuable insights into the evolutionary pressures and adaptations that have shaped the morphology and function of these specialized structures.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
