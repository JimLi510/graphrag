{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**LITORIA CAERULEA**\n\nLitoria caerulea, also known as the Blue Mountain Tree Frog or the Goliath Frog, is a species of frog. It is a species of tree frog being studied by researchers, which suggests that it has been the subject of scientific investigation in order to gain a deeper understanding of its behavior, habitat, and other characteristics.\n\nFurthermore, Litoria caerulea's toe pad mucus is also being studied, indicating that this particular aspect of the frog's biology is of interest to scientists. Overall, Litoria caerulea appears to be an important subject of study in the field of herpetology, with researchers seeking to learn more about its unique characteristics and behaviors.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by assuming that all descriptions refer to the same entity, Litoria caerulea. If there were any actual contradictions between the descriptions, I would have attempted to resolve them in a way that is consistent with the available information.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
