{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**NANOPILLARS**\n\nThe NANOPILLARS are a dense array of pillars that cover the surface of epithelial cells, specifically on the toe pads. These structures are presumably the ones that come into contact with the force plate. In addition to their presence on biological surfaces, NANOPILLARS also serve as structural components in composite materials, featuring prominently on the surface of pad epithelial cells and toe pad surfaces. They were studied in a text and are mentioned as a type of structure within it.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
