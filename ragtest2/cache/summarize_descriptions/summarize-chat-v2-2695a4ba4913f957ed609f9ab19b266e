Specifically, they are the co-author of a study on the adhesion properties of tree frogs to surfaces with varying levels of surface energy. This suggests that Crawford N's work focuses on the biological and physical sciences, possibly in the field of biomechanics or materials science.\n\nNote: I have not found any information about an author named \"CRAWFORD N\" being the sole author of a scientific paper, so I have only included the co-authorship description in the summary.
