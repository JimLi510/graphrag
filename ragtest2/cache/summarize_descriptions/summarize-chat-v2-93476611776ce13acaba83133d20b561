{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**CAPILLARITY**\n\nCapillarity is a dominant force in tree frog adhesion, contributing significantly to the adhesion strength of their toe pads. It is also the mechanism responsible for this adhesion strength on hydrophilic surfaces. In fact, capillarity is the phenomenon that dominates adhesion strength when the surface is hydrophilic, making it a crucial factor in the ability of tree frogs to adhere to certain surfaces.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
