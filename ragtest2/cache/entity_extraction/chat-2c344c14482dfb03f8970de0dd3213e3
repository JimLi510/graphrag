Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

Many more examples are described in a recent review by Sun & Bhushan [4].\n\ng/journal/rsta\n\nThe adhesive mechanisms of climbing animals have clear-cut implications for biomimetics.\n\nFor example, they adhere well to many surfaces, adhesion is reversible so that the adhesive is re-usable, and only stick when required [5,6]. Additionally, they self-clean, so that they are resistant to failure through the accumulation of dirt particles [7–9]. Initially, work was mainly carried out P\n\non geckos [5,10,11], because they are among the heaviest animals using reversible adhesion for hil.T\n\ntheir locomotion and have an amazing ability to run across ceilings.
