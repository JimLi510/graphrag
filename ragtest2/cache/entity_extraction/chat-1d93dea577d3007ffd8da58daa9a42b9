However, gecko-inspired materials/devices have caught most of the attention because the origin of gecko adhesion is considered mainly to be due to van der Waals forces so that gecko-mimicking can simply focus on the design and construction of pillar-like structures with various materials and dimensions. Though simple hexagonal structures are present on the toe pads of tree frogs, they are covered by an array of Ph\n\nnanopillars and the mechanism of its adhesion is much more complicated, as described above.\n\nil.T\n\nThough the toe pads of tree frogs look quite different from the hairy gecko pads (figure 2 a), rans\n\nthey both can be considered as pillar arrays [45]. A variety of manufacturing technologies [4]\n\n.R.\n\nhave been developed to construct pillar arrays in materials with Young’s moduli ranging from Soc\n\n1TPa to several MPa (for instance, 1TPa of carbon nanotube (CNT) [46], several GPa of polymers\n\n.A37\n\nlike polyurethane (PU) [47], polystyrene [48], polystyrene-block-poly(vinyl-2-pyridine) (PS-b-7:\n\nP2VP) [49] and 1–3 MPa of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [50]).
