[23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n‘remaining’ friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction, strongly suggesting that, during such times, there is actual contact between structures on the toe pads (presumably the nanopillars) and the force plate.\n\nFinally, as has been made clear from the above, these miniature force plates are particularly suitable for measuring the maximum adhesive and friction forces that tree frog toe pads can produce, since both the maximum force and the area of contact are easy to measure. In the gliding frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, the calculated values were 1.45 ± 1.14 mN mm−2 ( N = 33) for adhesive force and 6.21 ± 5.11 mN mm−2 ( N = 24) for friction [17]. This result supports one of the main\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusions of Langowski et al. [16], that toe pads are optimally developed for friction rather than 13\n\nadhesion.\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 3.
