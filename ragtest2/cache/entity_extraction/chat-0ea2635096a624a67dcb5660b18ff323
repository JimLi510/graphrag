Biomimetics of tree frog adhesion and friction\n\nypublishing\n\nLearning from biology to develop new materials and devices, aiming to solve problems in daily life, medical, industry, etc., comes along with human history, though the word ‘biomimetics’ is a relatively new word, coined by Otto Schmitt in 1957. The mimicking of the clinging abilities of geckos and tree-frogs are always attractive for people, so that animal-inspired adhesives have\n\n.org/journal/rsta\n\naroused more and more attention in recent years. However, gecko-inspired materials/devices have caught most of the attention because the origin of gecko adhesion is considered mainly to be due to van der Waals forces so that gecko-mimicking can simply focus on the design and construction of pillar-like structures with various materials and dimensions. Though simple hexagonal structures are present on the toe pads of tree frogs, they are covered by an array of Ph\n\nnanopillars and the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
