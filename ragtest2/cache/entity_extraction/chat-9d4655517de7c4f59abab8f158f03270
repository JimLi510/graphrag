The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement.
