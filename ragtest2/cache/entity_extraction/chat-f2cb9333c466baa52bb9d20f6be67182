The theory was demonstrated by a macroscopic experiment, where the frog-inspired patterns were mounted on metal pieces and allowed to slide on a rotating surface covered with water (figure 16 c). However, Cheng et al. reported a contradictory result that the wet friction of corner-sliding was higher in both hexagonal and rhomboid pillar arrays [74]. Using Chinese ink as the indicator, the liquid squeezing out of the contact interface was found to be more effective in the direction of corner-sliding (figure 16 a). In the direction of side-sliding, liquid may flow into the contact interface due to the tilting of pillars and the flow pattern, resulting in decreased friction [74]. Recently, distinctive arch-shaped structures (figure 16 b) were reported to provide even larger wet friction force than tree frog-inspired hexagonal patterns, due to their optimal drainage effect and the high stiffness of the patterns [75]. This offers new possibilities for the design of wet adhesives in future.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the bioinspired wet adhesive exhibits better performance on rough than smooth substrates [76,77].
