Conclusion and outlook\n\nypublishing\n\nIt is clear that tree frogs exhibit outstanding wet adhesion properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years, both in our understanding of how tree frogs adhere and in the development of tree frog-inspired wet adhesives. But many questions remain unanswered. For instance, while\n\n.or\n\nmost of the tree frog-mimicking studies have focused on the micropattern on the toe pad, more g/journal/rsta\n\nattention should be given to forming a better understanding of the role of the nanostructures.\n\nCould there be synergistic interactions between the micro- and nanostructures and the mucus?\n\nMoreover, since the animals keep secreting all the time, the liquid volume at the contacting interface should change accordingly. How will this dynamic process contribute to adhesion and P\n\nfriction during the locomotion of animals? And can we make use of the dynamic process? The hil.T\n\nanswers to these questions could deepen our understanding of the adhesion of tree frogs and ran\n\nspeed the development of applications of bioinspired wet adhesion.\n\ns.R.\n\nData accessibility.
