From this information, the force per unit area of these toe pads can be calculated (figure 11 d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is statistically significant ( r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]\n\ndemonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging surfaces. As the angle of tilt increases, tree frogs spread their limbs out sideways, and to a more limited extent, forwards or backwards as well. As figure 11 shows, this reduces the angle of\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n11\n\n)2\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oya\n\n10\n\n100\n\nlsociet\n\nypublishing\n\nmass (g)\n\n1\n\n10\n\ntoe-pad area (mm\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n.or\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\ng/journal/rsta\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nSVL (mm)\n\n( c)\n\n( d )\n\n)\n\n180\n\n10\n\n–2\n\n135\n\nPhil.Tra\n\n90\n\n1\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
