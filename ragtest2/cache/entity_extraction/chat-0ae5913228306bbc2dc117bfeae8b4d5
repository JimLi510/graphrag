Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E â‰ˆ 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information on deeper structures), are significantly higher, giving a median value of 5.7 MPa. Surface structures will thus have an increased resistance to wear. By contrast, the innermost layers, lying close to sub-dermal lymph spaces and a capillary network, have much lower elastic moduli and thus are extremely soft and pliable. Keratin filaments run inwards from the surface (figure 3) into the pad allowing the pad to maintain its shape in spite of the softness of the pad material [18,24,30,31].\n\n\n\n\n\npolygonal\n\n4\n\ntoe pad\n\nepithelial cells\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n( c)\n\nyalsociet\n\nypublishing\n\n.or\n\n100 mm\n\n5 mm\n\ng/journal/rsta\n\n( d )\n\n( e)\n\nPhil.Tran\n\n1 mm\n\n500 nm\n\ns.R.S\n\ntightly packed nanopillars (SEM and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
