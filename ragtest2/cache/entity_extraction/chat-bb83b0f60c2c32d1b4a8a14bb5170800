Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) used to measure the thickness of the fluid layer under a toe pad of a living, adhering tree frog ( Litoria caerulea). What one sees is the interference pattern resulting from the interference of light reflected from the surface of the pad with light reflected from the top surface of the glass to which the frog is adhering. By comparing images of the same pad with green and blue monochromatic light, one can identify which fringe is which, and thus estimate the thickness of the fluid layer under each pad epithelial cell. ( a) A representative IRM image and ( b) the calculated thickness of the fluid layer along the white arrow in ( a). Note that this arrow goes through the middle of an epithelial cell, and that the thickness of the fluid layer at these points is very small. ( c) Opening the aperture of the microscope reduces the depth of focus so that only zero-order fringes are seen, allowing a more accurate measurement of pad/ground distances under the pad epithelial cells. As shown in ( d), 41% of the epithelial cells have an average fluid film thickness in the range 0–5 nm. Reproduced from Federle et al.
