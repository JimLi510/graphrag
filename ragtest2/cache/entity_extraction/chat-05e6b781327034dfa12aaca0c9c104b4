Thus, the friction force was double that of commercial products and stretched the moist skin much better. Also, Chen et al. prepared PDMS polygonal arrays and applied them to the gripping surface of surgical graspers (figure 18 b). Compared to the traditional tooth-textured surgical grasper, the new design can greatly reduce the gripping force, reducing damage to soft tissue [74]. More recently, a biomimetic skin patch inspired by the hexagonal pattern of tree frog toe pads and the convex cup of octopus suckers has been reported\n\n(figure 18 c) [83]. The patch exhibited outstanding adhesion performance on human skin, even in\n\n\n\n\n\na water flowing environment. In addition, following coating with reduced graphene oxide, the 19\n\npatch could serve as a flexible electrode, sensitive enough to receive bio-signals on a wet skin, r\n\neven under motion.\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 5. Conclusion and outlook\n\nypublishing\n\nIt is clear that tree frogs exhibit outstanding wet adhesion properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years, both in our understanding of how tree frogs adhere and in the development of tree frog-inspired wet adhesives. But many questions remain unanswered.
