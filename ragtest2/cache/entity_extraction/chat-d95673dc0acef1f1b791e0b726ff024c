Recently, Tulchinsky & Gat [41] have introduced the new concept of\n\n.So\n\n‘temporary adhesion’ by ignoring inertial and capillary effects, based on the interaction between c.A37\n\nelastic deformation and viscous flow. During tests on a ‘model toe pad’, the pad generated forces 7\n\nthat resisted slip for periods in excess of 200 s. This is fine for a moving frog, but could present\n\n:20190131\n\nproblems for a frog at rest. Also, as the fluid used in the model toe pad (silicone oil) had a viscosity several orders of magnitude greater than tree frog mucus, it remains unclear whether the mechanism is applicable to frogs.\n\nToe pad adhesion and friction forces. Tree frogs are good climbers, many tropical species being found high in the canopy of rain forests. On effectively flat surfaces (e.g. smooth tree trunks), adhesion is the only means by which tree frogs can climb without falling, but on smaller diameter structures (e.g. small stems/twigs), they can additionally climb using adduction forces by grasping around these structures with their digits [22]. Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
