Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb vertical and overhanging surfaces, and a small tree frog can hang on to an inverted glass plate using just its toe pads [32]. At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14]. Frogs are weighed and then placed ‘head-up’ on a smooth surface on a rotation platform that is rotated slowly from 0°\n\n(horizontal), through 90° (vertical) to 180° (upside-down). The angles at which the frog falls from the surface (fall angle) are recorded. These fall angles are used to calculate maximum adhesive forces by simple trigonometry [32]. If the total toe pad area is also measured, these values can be converted to the force per unit area that toe pads can generate.
