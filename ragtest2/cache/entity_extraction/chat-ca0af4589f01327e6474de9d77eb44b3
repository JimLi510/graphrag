The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
