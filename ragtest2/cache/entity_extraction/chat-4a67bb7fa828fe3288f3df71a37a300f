However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads, the pillar tops are never smooth. As described above, concave nanostructures have been found on the toe pads of tree frogs (figure\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
