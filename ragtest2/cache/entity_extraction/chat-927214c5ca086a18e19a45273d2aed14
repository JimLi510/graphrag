As expected, adhesive forces fell to low levels, but recovered following removal of the water (not shown). What was not expected was that friction forces declined as well. The only possible conclusion, supported by subsequent experiments examining the effects of the procedure on the thickness of the fluid layer under the pad using interference reflection microscopy, was that this simple procedure had increased the pad–ground distance. Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces) that depended on close contact of pad and surface. The experiment is, however, interesting, even though it did not confirm the dominant role of capillarity that it was intended to test. This is because it demonstrates another, equally Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nimportant role for capillary forces in holding the pad close enough to the ground to allow the other forces to exert their adhesive action.\n\nA second interesting result resulting from single pad force recordings comes from the work of Federle et al. [23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n‘remaining’ friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
