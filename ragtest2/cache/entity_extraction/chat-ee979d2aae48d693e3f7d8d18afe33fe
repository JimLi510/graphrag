Tree/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21]. Most of these families are arboreal, living in trees or shrubs (tree frogs such as Hypsiboas boans (figure 1)). However, adhesive pads are also found in frogs living in the region of waterfalls (torrent frogs of the family Ranidae). The adhesive pads are located on\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n3\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet ypublishing\n\n.org/journal/rsta\n\nPhil.Trans.R\n\nhypsiboas boans\n\n.Soc.A\n\nFigure 1.
