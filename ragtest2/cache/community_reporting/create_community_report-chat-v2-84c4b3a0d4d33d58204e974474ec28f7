They have toe pads, which play an important role in their natural environment, particularly in wet adhesion. In fact, Tree Frogs use wet adhesion to move around and interact with their surroundings. Their toe pad structure shows similarities among the species studied, indicating a shared adaptation for this purpose.\n\nInterestingly, Tree Frogs are distinct from other animals like hairy geckos, which have pads that look quite different from those of Tree Frogs. Unlike some other animals, Tree Frogs cannot run across ceilings, but their adhesive properties allow them to thrive in their natural environment.\n\nThe study of Tree Frog toe pads has been conducted, and they have been found to be an essential part of their biology, particularly in wet environments. Overall, Tree Frogs are fascinating creatures with unique adaptations that enable them to navigate and interact with their surroundings in a way that is distinct from other animals.\",13\n21,ADHESIVE TOE PADS,Part of tree frog anatomy being studied,2\n231,BUSH-CRICKETS,,2\n164,FROGS,Animals used in experiments to measure adhesive forces,2\n170,GROWTH,Study on effects of growth on adhesion of tree frog toe pads,1\n289,MICROCHANNELS BETWEEN PILLARS,Structural feature of tree frog toe pads allowing effective drainage of liquid from contact area,1\n293,MICROSTRUCTURE,Toe pads of animals considered in wet adhesion study,1\n165,ROTATION PLATFORM,Device used to measure adhesive forces in tree frogs,1\n166,SMOOTH SURFACE,Surface used in experiments to measure adhesive forces,1\n318,STRUCTURED ADHESIVES,Type of material mentioned in the text,1\n171,TILTING EXPERIMENTS,Experiments demonstrating special strategies of tree frogs to maintain adhesion on overhanging surfaces,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n26,TREE FROGS,GECKOS,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**Summary for TREE FROGS and GECKOS**\n\nTREE FROGS and GECKOS share a common trait in exhibiting adhesive properties, which enable them to stick to surfaces.
