It is also the mechanism responsible for this adhesion strength on hydrophilic surfaces. In fact, capillarity is the phenomenon that dominates adhesion strength when the surface is hydrophilic, making it a crucial factor in the ability of tree frogs to adhere to certain surfaces.\",4\n30,TOE PAD,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\nThe TOE PAD refers to a specific surface or toe pad that is being studied. It is part of the tree frog's anatomy, and researchers are using a model to study its adhesion properties. This suggests that the TOE PAD plays an important role in the tree frog's ability to adhere to surfaces, and scientists are interested in understanding this phenomenon through their research.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by assuming that the descriptions are related to the same entity (TOE PAD) and providing a summary that incorporates all of the provided information.\",17\n14,TREE FROG,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\nThe TREE FROG is a species that has inspired biomimetic research.\",3\n58,AFM INDENTER,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**AFM Indenter**\n\nThe AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) Indenter is a device used to measure the elastic modulus of surfaces.
