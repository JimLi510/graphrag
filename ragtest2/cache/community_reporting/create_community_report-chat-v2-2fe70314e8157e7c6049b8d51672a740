This remarkable trait allows them to run across ceilings and other smooth surfaces with ease, distinguishing them from tree frogs which lack this capability. As a result, geckos have become a subject of interest in scientific research, particularly in the fields of biology and physics, where their adhesive properties are being studied and understood.\n\nNote: I've resolved any potential contradictions by focusing on the common thread among all descriptions, which is that geckos possess the ability to run across ceilings.
