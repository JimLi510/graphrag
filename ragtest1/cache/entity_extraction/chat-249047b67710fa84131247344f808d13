One of the younger siblings, referred to as '闰土' or Drunce in English (\"黄瘦些，颈子上没有银圈罢了\"), has not seen their father before due to being a newborn at that time (“第五个孩子”).

She is also excited upon hearing Zhen Tu’s return home as she has not seen their newborn child for the first time since birth (“知道老爷回来……”).\n3.
